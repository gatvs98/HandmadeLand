# HandmadeLand

This is a small website with the objective of serving as an online store for products made by craftsmen and craftswomen.
This project is being developed as a hobby, to get my mind out of everyday work and also as a way to practice with some technologies I use in the projects we develop in our company

## How to run the application

Before you can run this application, you need to make sure you have a PostgreSQL database, named **HandmadeLand**, created and you have a user with the following credentials: 

**Username:** handmadeuser
**Password:** handmadeuser

After that, you just need to run `mvn clean package` on the root folder of the Project, and run `java -Jar .\target\HandmadeLand-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`. 
You can then access the application by going to http://localhost:8080 in your preferred browser!
